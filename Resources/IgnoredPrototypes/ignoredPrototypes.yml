# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:

 - /Prototypes/Guidebook
 - /Prototypes/lobbyscreens.yml
 - /Prototypes/radio_channels.yml
 - /Prototypes/Entities/Objects/Devices/encryption_keys.yml
